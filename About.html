<h1> About Us </h1>


<p>
The Gadget Store brings technology to your fingertips. We are in the digital age and not all are fully participating.<br> <br>

Something that is a major concern to us. People in the higher income groups have more disposable income to acquire gadgets and tech. All these devices were invented to enhance your life, free up more time and streamlining your life. The internet of things is here and we want all to participate…….. irrespective of income or background.<br><br>

Join us in creating a community of people that are interconnected and have the common goal of all-inclusive community growth. Those communities are not separated by culture or income. These devices, used in the morally correct manner, are there to enhance our lives. Some of us have technophobia and we need to conquer our fears.
